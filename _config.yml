  I am also skilled in securing APIs with robust <span class="blue">authorization</span>, and <span class="blue">authentication</span>, mechanisms to ensure data safety and compliance.

  I am deeply familiar with best practices in software development, which I apply rigorously to ensure the quality and reliability of my work. My comprehensive understanding of <span class="blue">CI/CD</span>, particularly with <span class="blue">GitHub Actions</span> and <span class="blue">Azure DevOps (ADO)</span> pipelines, allows me to automate tests, builds, and deployments, facilitating the swift and consistent delivery of software updates. Moreover, I have a demonstrated history of <span class="blue">leading teams</span> to success by employing <span class="blue">Agile</span> methodologies effectively. 

  In my professional endeavors, I leverage technologies such as <span class="blue">Azure</span> for scalable cloud solutions, including hands-on experience with <span class="blue">Azure Data Factory</span> for data engineering processes, and <span class="blue">Databricks</span> with <span class="blue">PySpark</span> for advanced data processing and analytics. 
  I am also proficient in <span class="blue">SQL</span>  for database management and query optimization. Additionally, I utilize <span class="blue">Kafka</span> for real-time data streaming and <span class="blue">MLOps</span> tools like <span class="blue">MLFlow</span> to oversee and optimize machine learning workflows, ensuring the efficient and dependable deployment of AI models.

  As a consultant, I have had the opportunity to work across a diverse range of industries, including <span class="blue">banking</span>, <span class="blue">insurance</span>, <span class="blue">government</span>, <span class="blue">oil and gas</span>, and <span class="blue">supply chain</span>. This exposure has allowed me to adapt my technical expertise to address industry-specific challenges and deliver tailored solutions that drive value for my clients.

  I am a native Greek speaker 🇬🇷, possess a C2 level proficiency in English 🇬🇧, am conversational in Spanish 🇪🇸, and have a foundational understanding of German 🇩🇪.

          The Department's rigorous 5-year program equipped me with a solid scientific and engineering foundation, enabling me to contribute effectively to the study, design, development, and analysis of both software and hardware systems. The curriculum also emphasized theoretical approaches to communication, computation, coordination, and the evaluation of computational objects and artifacts.

          I graduated with a commendable grade of 7.87/10, which reflects my strong academic performance and understanding of the subject matter.

          For my thesis, titled "Model-Agnostic Interpretability with Shapley Values," I delved into the realm of machine learning interpretability, exploring innovative techniques to enhance the transparency and understanding of AI models.
