  Hi, my name's Andreas, and I'm an <span class="blue">AI Engineer</span> currently working as a Senior Technology Consultant at EY.
  With extensive experience in <span class="blue">Python</span>, <span class="blue">AI</span>, and <span class="blue">Machine Learning</span>, I design and implement advanced systems to tackle complicated problems. My proficiency in building efficient <span class="blue">data pipelines</span> is complemented by my experience in designing <span class="blue">REST APIs</span>, <span class="blue">micro-services</span>, and <span class="blue">event-driven</span> architectures, ensuring seamless data flow and processing.

  I am well-versed in best software practices, which I apply rigorously to ensure the quality and reliability of my work. I also have in-depth knowledge of <span class="blue">CI/CD</span> processes using <span class="blue">GitHub Actions</span>, which I leverage to automate testing, building, and deployment, ensuring fast and reliable delivery of software updates. Additionally, I have a proven track record of effectively <span class="blue">leading teams</span> to achieve successful outcomes in an <span class="blue">Agile</span> manner. 

  In my work, I utilize technologies like <span class="blue">Azure</span> for scalable cloud solutions and <span class="blue">Kafka</span> for real-time data streaming. My skills in <span class="blue">MLOps</span> using tools like <span class="blue">MLFlow</span> enable me to manage and streamline machine learning workflows, ensuring efficient and reliable deployment of AI models.

  My native language is Greek üá¨üá∑, I am proficient in English üá¨üáß at a C2 level, conversational in Spanish üá™üá∏, and have basic knowledge of German üá©üá™
